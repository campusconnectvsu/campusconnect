## Overview

### Description
**Campus Connect** is an Android mobile application designed **exclusively for Virginia State University (VSU) students** to discover, manage, and attend campus events in one central platform.

At VSU, event information is scattered across flyers, emails, and social media, leading to missed opportunities and low participation. Campus Connect addresses this challenge by providing a **campus-only hub** where students can:

- Browse events divided into **Cultural, Educational, Social, Career-Oriented, Sports, and Community Service** categories
- Use a **real-time interactive map** to locate events and (optionally) see friends, classmates, and faculty locations, with **privacy features** like ghost mode
- RSVP directly to events with one click (**Accept/Decline**)
- Accepted events go automatically into a **personal calendar** 
- Declined events are removed from the feed
- Receive **smart notifications** about upcoming events, time, and location

By being **limited to VSU students via .edu email verification**, the app fosters a **safe and trusted environment** that strengthens the sense of community and belonging on campus.

## App Evaluation

- **Category**: Campus Event Management / Student Engagement
- **Mobile**: Android app built with Kotlin (Android Studio), Firebase for authentication + notifications, Google Maps SDK for real-time maps
- **Story**: VSU students often miss out on events because information is fragmented. Campus Connect creates a **single, student-only platform** where every event is easy to find and track.
- **Market**: Targeted only for Virginia State University. This ensures exclusivity and a **community-focused adoption** compared to broader event apps.
- **Habit**: Students will use it daily to browse events, weekly to RSVP, and regularly to check reminders and maps before attending events.
- **Scope**: MVP includes login with VSU .edu verification, event feed with categories, RSVP system, calendar integration, real-time map, and notifications. Future expansions may include reviews, event feedback, and advanced social features.
